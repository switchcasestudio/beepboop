## Description

This project is an interactive web application that involves receiving an input from the user (number) and returning a list of values from 0 to the inputted number, with specific substitutions made based on the conditions outlined below.
It has a user-friendly interface, including a field for users to input their preferred number. The application should also handle exceptions where the user doesn't input a valid number.
Upon receiving the user's input, the application will generate a list of numbers starting from 0 up to the user's input.
 * If a number contains a '1', it will be replaced entirely with "Beep!" regardless of the other digits in the number.
 * If a number contains a '2' but no '1', it will be replaced entirely with "Boop!"
 * If a number contains a '3' but no '1' or '2', it will be replaced entirely with "Won't you be my neighbor?".
The user can reverse the output by clicking a button.
Once the substitutions have been made, the application will return and display the new list of values to the user with an option to reverse the list and display it from end to start.
